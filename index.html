                <h2>Hello! My name is Ethan Carson.</h2>
                <p>I am an aspiring Web Developer from Germantown, Maryland. During my time in college as a Computer
                    Engineer,
                    I took a couple of web development courses and found that I enjoyed making websites. After
                    graduating, I decided that I wanted to pursue a career in web development and so I continued to take
                    courses to
                    further improve my skills.
                </p>
                <p>I decided to build this website in order to practice my front-end development skills while also
                    creating an
                    alternate type of resume. You will be able to read about my education, skills and experience, and
                    there are links to
                    my LinkedIn and Github at the top. Thanks for visiting!

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I graduated from the University of Maryland (College Park) in the Spring of 2020 with a degree in
                Computer Engineering
                and a cummulative GPA of 3.28. Throughout the 4 years I attended UMD, I took a number of courses that
                would prove beneficial
                to a Web Developer including Full-Stack Web Development classes as well as courses on the subjects of
                Computer Security, Cryptography,
                and Software Engineering. Additionally, after graduating I took a more in-depth Web Development course
                from Codecademy that allowed me
                to become more comfortable with the aspects of Web Development I was familiar with (HTML, CSS and
                Javascript), while also learning
                about new frameworks and technologies I would need to become a more versatile developer (React,
                PostgreSQL, etc.).</p>

            <h2>Skills and Experience</h2>
            <p>While I learned a lot of technical knowledge while studying Computer Engineering at UMD, I also gained a
                lot of useful skills as well. Throughout my coursework, there were many times where I had to work
                cooperatively on a
                long-term project with several other students. This taught me how to effectively communciate with a
                group (and even lead sometimes) in
                order to come together with other teams working on different components (whether they be software or
                hardware) to create an
                effective product. Additionally, since college can often throw large amounts of work for you to complete
                in a short period of time, this
                taught me how to learn quickly and how to manage my time efficiently.

            <h2>More About Me</h2>
            <p>In addition to programming, another thing I enjoy doing im my free time is drumming. I've been playing
                the drums for nearly 15 years, and I was even on the drumline my freshman year at UMD where I played
                tenor drums, although I probably prefer playing the drumset. Some of my favorite drummers are John
                Bonhmam from Led Zepplin and Neil Peart from Rush, and I will often drum along to their music. I also
                enjoy playing video games since they are something fun I can do with my friends who now-a-days can be
                too faraway for us to get together in person. Video games are also good for unplugging your brain after 
                coding all day. Some of my favorite games are Portal 2, Enter the Gungeon and Super Smash Bros.
